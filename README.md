Jarvis Personal Assistant

Jarvis is an AI-powered personal assistant built using Python and APIs. Despite having no prior experience with Python, I developed this project by learning from online resources and using ChatGPT for guidance. Jarvis can respond to voice commands, perform tasks, and fetch information using AI-driven responses, demonstrating problem-solving, adaptability, and the ability to step out of my comfort zone.

Features:

Voice command recognition

AI-driven responses via API

Task automation

Information retrieval

Tech Used:

Python

APIs for AI response integration

Learning Outcome:
This project helped me quickly grasp Python basics, work with APIs, and apply knowledge to create a practical, interactive assistant.
